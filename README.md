ESP-IDF Gatt Server Service Table Demo
===============================================

This project implements a clock service to maintain time and execute procedures at pre-recorded time points. The execution of the clock and checking alarms is enabled using the internal RTC based system clock.

The user interface is provided using a BLE GATT server. The settings and configuration are loaded using a GATT client running on an Android application.
